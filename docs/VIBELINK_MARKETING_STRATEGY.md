This strategy is designed to be executed incrementally. Start with the quick wins, establish momentum on TikTok and Instagram, then expand to paid advertising and partnerships.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Consistency - Post daily, engage daily
2. Quality - Every piece of content reflects the brand
3. Authenticity - Real customers, real events, real stories
4. Speed - Move fast, iterate quickly
5. Community - Build relationships, not just transactions

**Remember:** The best marketing is a delighted customer sharing their beautiful invitation with 100+ guests. Every design is a marketing opportunity.
